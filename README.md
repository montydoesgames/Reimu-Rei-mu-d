# Reimu Rei-mu'd
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀It's time to once again revisit your favourite floating island, with a new character!

This Sonic 3 A.I.R. mod adds Reimu Hakurei from Touhou into the game without overriding any other characters. Since a simple skin mod would not do this character justice, Reimu has also been given a unique move, where she throws her Gohei Stick!

## The Gohei Stick - How it works:

By pressing the jump button a second time after jumping, as you would Sonic's Insta-Shield or Tails' flight, you spawn in the Gohei Stick (or it is brought to you if it is already active). From here, it will continue to rotate around you so long as you remain in the air with the jump button held. In this state, the Gohei Stick is able to collect Rings and defeat enemies further away from you than even Sonic's Insta-Shield could reach! Reimu also gains the ability to deflect and ignore the same projectiles that Sonic's Insta-Shield allows. If you touch the ground in this state the Gohei Stick will simply dissappear until you reactivate the move.

Once you let go of the button, the Gohei Stick is thrown in the direction Reimu is facing. Reimu will lose her projectile ignoring and deflecting properties at this point, however the Gohei Stick will still be able to defeat badniks and collect rings! After a couple of seconds, it will stop briefly before homing in on Reimu, unloading either after it gets close enough or after 5 seconds of being unable to return to the screen.

This move is a boss shredder, making quick work of most bosses in the game with it's large hitbox and long duration, which still provides great assistance to even Super and Hyper Reimu!

## Extras

This mod features a few minor additions to help customise your experience. These are:

- 11 different palettes for Reimu, based on existing Touhou or other videogame media, along with a few variants of Reimu's main palette
- Marisa as Reimu's pilot for the Tornado, with her own set of 3 palettes, mirroring some of Reimu's palettes
- Reimu's very own Super and Hyper theme, being "Eastern Mystical Tale of Romance"

All of these can be accessed and changed via the Reimu Rei-mu'd options, found in the Mods category of the Options Menu, accessible in Sonic 3 A.I.R.'s Main Menu.
